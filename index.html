    <h2>Password Protected Message</h2>
    <p>Hi Duggaaa, to ensure that only you can open it, enter your secret name as password:</p>
    <input type="password" id="passwordInput" placeholder="Enter password">
    <button onclick="checkPassword()">Submit</button>

    <div id="message">I need to be honest and open with you because this situation is hurting me deeply. First, I want to make it clear that I have never accused you of cheating. I trust you when you say there is nothing between you and him, and I know you wouldnâ€™t cross that line. But the repeated issues surrounding this same guy are what hurt me the most.

You know how I feel about the time and attention you give him. Even after I explained how it was affecting us before, it still feels like nothing changed. What made it worse is when you told me you were busy, but I later found out you had time for him. That made me feel like I wasnâ€™t important enough to you.

Apart from this, today is bhaiya's death anniversary and it was you When I was at my lowestâ€”dealing with my brotherâ€™s deathâ€”you were there for me. That meant everything to me, and I know how much you care. Today is a hard day for me, and Iâ€™m already struggling with my emotions. Adding this to it is just too much to handle our fight and family problem. I want you to be with me.

I know weâ€™ve both said hurtful things in anger while fighting. You didnâ€™t mean what you said, and you know I didnâ€™t either. But we canâ€™t let those words define where we go from here. If youâ€™re willing to fix this relationship, I need us to sit down, talk calmly, and work through the real issues together.

Iâ€™m asking you to call me when youâ€™re ready to have that conversation. Iâ€™m willing to work on this, but I canâ€™t do it alone. ðŸŽ‰</div>
